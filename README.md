# UniMate AI — Student Life OS

A student productivity app: timetable, tasks, assignments, attendance, GPA tracking, and an AI study assistant.

## Run locally
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Push this folder to your GitHub repo (replace the old single `UniMateAI.jsx` file with everything here — `package.json`, `index.html`, `src/`, `api/`).
2. Import the repo on vercel.com (framework preset: Vite — auto-detected).
3. **Important:** in your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables, add:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = your Anthropic API key (get one at console.anthropic.com)
   This powers the AI Chat feature via the `/api/claude` serverless function, without exposing your key in the browser.
4. Deploy. Every future `git push` to `main` auto-redeploys.

## Data storage
All app data (tasks, timetable, profile, etc.) is currently saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so it's per-device and not synced across devices yet.
